        <p id="part1About">
          I'm Nicklaus Meadows and I am originally from Columbus, Ohio.
          Currently, my wife and I are living in a suburb of Columbus called
          Canal Winchester. We moved out here about 10 years ago after we met at
          OSU, while we both we're studying commercial photography. Since we've
          been out in Canal we have been developing a small homestead setup that
          we both really enjoy working on. We have some chickens, quail,
          turkeys, ducks and a nice sized garden. Professionally, I work for a
          chemical company in Columbus as a web designer and SEO analyst. Prior
          to my current position I worked on the front-end side of a school
          system's website and a commercial photographer for Lane Bryant and a
          local diamond company. I occasionally still pick up photography jobs
          on the side if it is the right fit, but mainly I have been shooting
          film for the enjoyment of the process. My wife and I really enjoy
          traveling, and in 2025 we're going on a trip to SC with a friend of
          mine to just take some nice photos and relax. In my spare time I
          really enjoy working on my old Jeep Wrangler. It was my dad's and I
          kept it after he passed. The Jeep is old enough to legally drink and
          driving through Ohio winter's for that long has really taken a toll on
          the frame and pretty much everything facing the pavement. So over the
          past few years I've been trying to restore it to the best of my
          abilities. Luckily, youtube is a huge help since a lot of people have
          owned these Jeeps and love making tutorial videos. Next summer, I hope
          to have it in well enough shape to take out for a nice cruise around
          the country.
